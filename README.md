# Health-Management-System
Author - Abeer Manchanda,
In this Health Management System made using python can be used to log and retrieve exercises and diet with time stamps.
Fisrt you have to choose whether you have to log or retrieve data. If then you chose log you have to specify exericise
or diet then you have to enter exercise you have done or food eaten then it will be stored. Then if you try to retreive
data you have to specify exercise or diet and then you will get all the data stored with particular time stamps.
Thank you!
